Public Scrutiny Office
======================

This is the source for a project designed to enable greater public scrutiny of Parliament in the UK.

This project stems from hack I did for Parliament Hack 2013 (at the start of Parliament week), an event run by 
Rewired State (see the hashtag #RSPARLY2013 on Twitter for more).

As the concept was well received (the hack won an award) and because I liked the idea myself, I've decided to 
keep it going. The code was pretty awful though so I decided to re-write the hack (origionally in PHP) in 
nodejs and mongodb. It uses ejs and express-patials for templating and layout.

Once I've got the basic functionality ported over I'll start working on adding new functionality like viewing MP's
and a more sophisticated way of viewing events.

If you have any suggestions or questions, you can reach me at me@iaincollins.com (or as @iaincollins on Twitter).
