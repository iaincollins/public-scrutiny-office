Public Scrutiny Office
======================

This is the source for a project designed to enable greater public scrutiny of Parliament in the UK.

It's a port of a hack I did for Parliament Hack 2013 from PHP to nodejs and mongodb.

It's up and running over at http://public-scrutiny-office.iaincollins.com

To run a copy of this site on your own system:

1) install nodejs and mongodb.
2) run 'npm install' to get dependancies.
3) run './scripts/get-bills.js' to populate the DB.
4) run 'node server.js' and connect to 'localhost:3000' to view the site.

Contributions most welcome! :)

Thank you to Parliament and Rewired State for putting on the hack, to the Parliament folks for being on hand to provide domain expertise and MySociety for the TheyWorkForYou API's.
