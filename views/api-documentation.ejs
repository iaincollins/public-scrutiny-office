      <h1>Public Scrutiny Office API </h1>
      <p>
        This site provides a simple API for Bills and allows you to fetch them as plain text and JSON.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2016 we are looking to move the API to use an structured data schema for Bills and Members and Events and at ways to editorialise events in Parliament.
      </p>
      <h3>Fetch Bills before Parliament</h3>
      <p>
        You can fetch the list of Bills before Parliament (along with some metadata about each Bill) by using:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/bills.json">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills.json</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also request just the most (or least) popular Bills and Bills yet to be published:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/bills/popular.json">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/popular.json</a><br/>
        <a href="/bills/unpopular.json">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/unpopular.json</a><br/>
        <a href="/bills/pending.json">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/pending.json</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Fetching information about a specific Bill</h3>
      <p>
        You can use the <strong>.hasText</strong> property on a Bill to check if there is text available for it and the
        <strong>.htmlUrl</strong> and <strong>.textUrl</strong> properties on each Bill object to get the full text of an individual Bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you know the URL for a bill you can get info for it in JSON, or just the bill text as HTML or plain text (UTF-8) directly by appending an appropriate file extention.
      </p>
      <p>
        e.g. for <a href="/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>JSON</strong>: <a href="/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers.json">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers.json</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HTML:</strong> <a href="/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers.html">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Plain Text</strong>: <a href="/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers.text">http://public-scrutiny-office.org/bills/2015-2016/investigatory-powers.text</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Fetching information about an MP or Peer</h3>
      <p>
        There is currently not an API for members on this site, please see the <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/membersdataplatform/">UK Parliament - Members' Names Data Platform</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An API exposing some information about members and Bills they have sponsored (and related information) is planned in future.
