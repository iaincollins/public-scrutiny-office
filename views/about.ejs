            <h3>Why this site was created</h3>
            <p>
                This project stems from a weekend hack I did for Parliament Hack 2013, an event run by Parliament
                and Rewired State to co-incide with Parliament Week.

                The concept seemed well received and the hack won an award. As I liked the idea myself, I've decided to 
                keep it going. The code was pretty awful though so I decided to port the hack from PHP to nodejs and mongodb,
                using express, express-partials and ejs for templating and layout.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's still in early development and not all the features from the hack have been ported over, but it is
                better written, faster and much less buggy than the origional. It relies a lot of dirty data taken from
                screen scraping because APIs are just not available for everything it does yet.

            <h3>The origional hack</h3>
            <p>
                PS: You can also find the origional hack over at <a href="http://parliament-hack-2013.iaincollins.com/">http://parliament-hack-2013.iaincollins.com/</a> - it too is on GitHub, but the code
                is pretty awful and I don't expect I'll be doing anything else with it.
